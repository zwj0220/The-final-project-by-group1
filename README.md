# The-final-project-by-group1
The final project of Depmap for biomedical  Python programming by Group 1
## Background
The lung is the main functional organ of our human, and lung cancer is mainly divided into small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, while non-small cell lung cancer accounts for about 85% of the cases, non-small cell lung cancer STAGE IV will have cancer metastasis, such as lung metastasis, bone metastasis, etc. Most deaths due to lung cancer are associated with tumor spread to secondary sites in the body through metastasis, but there is a large gap in our basic biological understanding of this process. We can use sequencing databases and perform biochemical analysis to find therapeutic targets and mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis.
## Methods
   * Datasets：CCLE
   * Visualization：Depmap
## Group member
Liu Xuefei, Wang Jianhui, Zhao Keyu, Ying Qianqian, Li Yifan, Zhang Wenjie
## Dataset
You can download from BB or email me.
## Result
1. Non-metastatic cell lines upregulate the NF-kb pathway, which is regulated by IRF2

2. ZFPM2 mutation affects HSD17B1 expression and thus regulates steroid synthesis pathway in the metastatic group
